- caves
- tunnels
- player
- Otyughs
- text based game 
-GUI showing the working of the dungeon

System creates a dungeon with a player and monsters in caves and tunnels from start to end along with the GUI representation of the same.

More information about the system requirements found in the [Link](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/90374/assignments/1197220)

The system is built following basic object oriented and SOLID principles.

## Features
The system has the following features with its Battle and Game Class and controller. 

-Game creation with caves and tunnels with a player and monsters.
-game with either a wrapping or non wrapping option.
-random start and end cave. treasures are assigned to random cave.
-player can detect the monsters with their smell.
-player can shoot the monster using the arrows.
- player can either win or loose based on the monsters.
- can have both text based and GUI based game.

 
## How to run
Jar file is provided along with the package. 

Extract the jar file Battle.jar and run the below command in the terminal
```
java -jar <<extracted_jar_file_location>>/Dungeon.jar
```

Example to run if the downloaded jar file is in the present working directory to run the game in ui
```
java -jar res/Dungeon.jar ui
```
Example to run if the downloaded jar file is in the present working directory to run the game in text 
```
java -jar res/Dungeon.jar text
```


## Design/Model Changes

- there are few extra methods in the implementation but no significant changes.
- A new interface was added to the dungeon and player class.
-A new interface was added to the monster class to represent monsters.
-A new class was used to help the building of the dungeon.
- A new interface to support the features of the view.

##Example Run 
The given example run shows the working gui of the dungeon game with the following features. 
- The player description above the game panel.
- The ability to move , shoot and pickup by the player.
-The player can navigate through the dungeon as he finds new ways through the caves.
- The smell of the Otyugh gets retraced as it gets killed.

##How to use the program
The input for the game is given through the command line argument
expected option is text or ui 
based on the input : This readme covers the ui part of the game as text game is self-explanatory
Keyboard key and operations.
up Arrows - Navigate/Move up
down Arrows - Navigate/Move down
left Arrows - Navigate/Move left
right Arrows - Navigate/Move right
key a - pickup arrow
key r - pickup ruby 
key e - pickup sapphire
key d - pickup diamond.
key s + arrow keys  + number of caves (1-5) - shoot.
option to quit the game.

## Assumptions

The system Dungeon is built on the following assumptions:

- the cave and tunnel which is next to the Otyugh has the highest smell level and decreases as the distance increases.
it implements the kruskal's algorithm.
it implements the dfs and bfs.


##Limitations
- The movement of the player can be improved by providing click events as an additional input
- This game supports a maximum of 12 rows and 12 columns game play as it does not implement scroll pane.
- The game can be further developed to implement animations for the arrows moving and 
killing, but it is limited to graphical representation for now
